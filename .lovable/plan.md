# NLG Consulting -- Full SEO Restructuring & Revenue Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

Complete restructuring of nlgconsulting.co to rank Page 1 on Google for SaaS & PropTech revenue consulting queries, achieve 30%+ CTR on niche keywords, and convert organic traffic into booked strategy calls.

---

## 1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Existing Pages (14 total, EN+FR)
- Home, About, Sales, Advisory, Web/Studio, Marketing, Ventures, Contact, Book, Privacy
- French mirrors at /fr/*

### Key Issues
- No silo architecture -- pages exist flat with no topical clustering
- Generic positioning ("B2B Lead Generation Agency") competing against thousands of agencies
- No dedicated pillar page connecting sub-services
- Missing high-intent niche pages (AI lead gen, SaaS monetization, PropTech consulting)
- No blog infrastructure for topical authority
- Book page is generic -- not optimized for SaaS/PropTech decision-makers
